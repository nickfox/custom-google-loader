####custom-google-loader

This is a custom version of google loader that I'm using for GpsTracker. Google's version of the loader which is here:

https://developers.google.com/loader/

does not seem to be supported anymore (jquery is at version 1.7.1 which is a few years old). So what I've done is removed all of the other frameworks that I'm not using (such as mooworks, scriptaculous, etc.) and updated it to jquery version:

1.11.0

and 

2.1.0

I also changed the google urls to https. This version is stripped down and supports jquery and google maps.
